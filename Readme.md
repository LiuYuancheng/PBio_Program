# Threats To MITRE(CWD,ATT&CK) Mapper

**Program Design Purpose**: we want to use the AI-LLM to help to process the threats scenario description document such as (technical blog, CTI report, cyber attack training note) to summarize the attack flow path in the material, then parse the cyber attack behaviors from the attack and map each the single attack behaviors to the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix to find the related attack tactic and technique.
